Code along with Design Course in order to learn [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

This crash course was a code-along by Design Course where he taught how to set up a SASS project and many of the features that SASS uses, such as:
- nested css, like putting your `<li>` in a `<ol>` in the css itself
- functions to perform tasks such as setting colours
- mixins

We also used an interesting website called [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) where you can set CSS properties based upon a type of shape. It makes for a visually interesting website design. 


Please have a look at the live project [here](https://zenidith.github.io/sass-crash-course/)
It is responsive! 

Happy Coding!
